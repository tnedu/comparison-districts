## comparison-districts

This repository contains business rules for TDoE's identification of similar districts. We ask that any teams releasing data using these comparison districts replicate the identification of similar districts in order to fully understand the methodology and results.

Start with the raw data in data/achievement_profile_data_2015_2016.csv. The methodology is described in methodology.md. Your similar districts should match the data/similar_districts.csv file.
